                    Hello! I'm {LastName} {FirstName}, a passionate and dedicated full-stack web developer currently in my second year of study at OFPPT. With a strong foundation in both Front-end and Back-end technologies, I enjoy building dynamic, user-friendly websites and applications.
                    Beyond my studies, Iâ€™m constantly exploring new tools and frameworks to enhance my skills. I also have a keen interest in cloud storage and website hosting, which led me to develop Argan Beauty, a project focused on seamless online services.
                    I'm looking to apply my knowledge in a real-world environment, collaborate with experienced developers, and further refine my expertise. If you're looking for a motivated and fast-learning intern, let's connect!
